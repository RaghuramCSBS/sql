What is an Aggregate Function in SQL?
An aggregate function in SQL returns one value after calculating multiple values of a column. We often use aggregate functions with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement.

There are 5 types of SQL aggregate functions:

Count()
Sum()
Avg()
Min()
Max()


GROUP BY
In SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to group rows by one or more columns.
to group the data before applying aggregate function
--> group by clause always after where clause and before order by clause
Example
SELECT COUNT(order_id), item
FROM Orders
GROUP BY item;

GROUP BY With HAVING Clause
We can use the GROUP BY clause with the HAVING clause to filter the result set based on aggregate functions. For example,

SELECT COUNT(customer_id), country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 1;
